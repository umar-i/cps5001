# Documentation

Keep documentation in `docs/` so it can be incorporated into the final report.

Suggested structure:
- `docs/architecture.md` - system architecture and interfaces.
- `docs/third-class.md` - Third Class summary (implemented baseline).
- `docs/lower-second.md` - 2:2 summary (implemented).
- `docs/diagrams/` - class diagrams and sequence diagrams (text formats preferred).
- `docs/evaluation.md` - empirical testing plan and results.
- `docs/ethics.md` - ethical considerations and reflection.
