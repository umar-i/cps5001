# Ethical Considerations (Placeholder)

Topics to address in the final report:
- fairness in allocation (urban vs rural coverage)
- transparency/explainability of dispatch decisions
- robustness and failure modes under overload
- privacy and data minimisation for incident data (even in simulation)
- bias from historical/simulated data and mitigation strategies
