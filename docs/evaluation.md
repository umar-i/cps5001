# Evaluation Plan (Placeholder)

This file will hold the empirical testing methodology and results:
- scenarios used (size, density, incident rates)
- metrics collected (dispatch time, response time, utilisation, fairness)
- comparisons (Dijkstra vs A*, caching on/off, prediction on/off)
- charts/tables produced from `data/out/`
