# Lower First Class (70-79) Deliverable (In Progress)

This document tracks progress toward the **Lower First Class** grade band.

## Target Outcomes

- Stronger predictive demand + proactive resource placement (not just a single hotspot move).
- Better dynamic adaptability: congestion/edge updates trigger rerouting where possible.
- Evidence of efficiency (reuse existing multi-source routing; keep update handling localised).
- Clear, report-ready evaluation notes + ethical considerations tied to exported metrics.

## Work Items

See `docs/todo-first.md`.
