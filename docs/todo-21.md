# 2:1 TODO (Upper Second Class 60–69)

Goal: reach the **2:1** software + report criteria from `requirements.txt` with small, testable increments.

## Software Artefact (2:1)

- [x] Efficient allocation algorithm: reduce routing recomputation (multi-source / caching)
- [x] Real-time updates: handle route changes (cancel + reassignment; optional reroute)
- [x] Strengthen multi-criteria dispatch scoring (severity prioritisation + ETA/distance + unit type constraints)
- [x] Improve metrics capture for evaluation (decisions, cancellations, reroutes)
- [x] Add at least one larger scenario to exercise update handling + export metrics

## Report Material (2:1)

- [x] Add `docs/upper-second.md` explaining what’s implemented for 2:1
- [x] Update `docs/evaluation.md` with scenarios + metrics + how to reproduce
- [x] Update diagrams to cover any new components/flows
- [x] Extend complexity analysis for new algorithms/caching choices
