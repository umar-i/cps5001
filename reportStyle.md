1	Overview



The font style to use throughout your document should be consistent and easy to read.  The font size for text in the body of your document should be 12 pt.  Headings should have a suitable font size e.g. 16 pt. for main section headings and 14 pt. for sub-headings.



In this section, you should explain the aim and objectives of the project.  You should provide a summary of the final design or architecture for your system.  

You should articulate the scope and limitations of your solution.

If relevant, you should summarise what requirements have been achieved. This can be summarised with the aid of a table.

A very brief summary (a couple of sentences) should be included to explain the structure for the remainder of the report.



 

2	Modules / Functionality



A heading should not be followed directly by another heading.  There should be some connecting text.  Thus, you should briefly describe the structure of this section here.

This section should provide a detailed summary of the functionality that has been implemented, including justifications and relevant citations where relevant.

The section can be divided into suitable sub-sections to focus on key areas or parts of the final solution e.g., GUI or part of the GUI, model, algorithm, etc.



2.1	Main Module or Sub-System



This section should focus on interesting aspects of the implementation.  Your explanations should include appropriate detail and terminology.  More complicated functions should have greater detail whilst smaller and similar functions can be grouped together in your explanation.  You may wish to include relevant code snippets to support your explanations.  However, you should ensure that you do not simply restate or summarise what is shown in the code but explain how it works (the what, how and why).

You should include code snippets as figures with appropriate captions.  An example of a code snippet is shown below:





The code snippet should be short, concise and appropriate formatted.  If the code snippet is from another source, then you should also include a suitable reference.



2.2	Other Module, Sub-System, Or Key Part



Relevant guidelines mentioned in the previous section should also be followed here. You can explain any additional functions (e.g. to improve code readability and reuse) or utilised additional constructs (e.g. exception handling) then this should be discussed here.



2.3	Other Module, Sub-System, Or Key Part



Relevant guidelines mentioned in the previous sections should also be followed here. Include relevant annotated screen-shots where relevant.  The screenshots should focus on the important aspects (i.e., be cropped appropriately) and include relevant annotations where appropriates.



 

3	Recommendations



You should briefly summarise what has been achieved and make some suitable recommendations for future work. 

4	References



This section should be included for references to any relevant literature that has been cited in this report. Note, many references are not expected for this report as it should focus on explaining the technical implementation. 

5	Appendices



Any appendices should be included here.
